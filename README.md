## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project, I tried to use the correct syntax for BEM. 

In previous projects I tried to use BEM-like naming for the classes, but didn't use the appropriate syntax.


### Useful resources

- [How to translate a design into HTML: Product Preview Card](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/) - I used this article as a guideline for writing accessible and semanticly correct HTML for this project. It also linked to helpful resources (inluding an article on BEM, which prompted me to actually use the correct syntax this time).
- [VoiceOver Keyboard Shortcuts on a Mac](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/voiceover-keyboard-shortcuts) - I used VoiceOver for the first time to test the `sr-only` content I used in the HTML. This article served as a helpful reference for the keyboard shortcuts.
